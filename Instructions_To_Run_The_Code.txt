1.Open 5 cmd instances and run below commands to execute 5 consumers
> python confluent_consumer.py 1
> python confluent_consumer.py 2
> python confluent_consumer.py 3
> python confluent_consumer.py 4
> python confluent_consumer.py 5

here the arguments in the command denotes the consumer instances 
eg. argument passed as 1 means 1st consumer instance
similarly, argument passed as 2 means 2nd consumer instance and so on.
The idea is to accept this argument and will be used to create separte json file for each
consumer based on the argument passed.

2. Open another cmd instance and run the producer code with below command
>python confluent_producer.py

3.Provide KeyBoard Enterrupt anytime to stop the process.
